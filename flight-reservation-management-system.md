// FLIGHT RESERVATION MANAGEMENT SYSTEM in Java:

1) DESCRIPTION:

Flight reservation application in Java that manages flights, passengers, and seat availability. Uses OOP principles, input validation, and console-based flow control for basic programming practice.

In this case, the project implements a flight reservation system by using three different classes: "Flight", "Reservation", and "FlightReservationSystem". The system allows users to check available flights, make a reservation if seats are free, and view reservation details along with flight information.

2) CLASSES:

· "Flight" Class: Contains data for each flight, such as flight number, origin, destination, and available seats.
· "Reservation" Class: Handles passenger details and associates them with a specific flight.
· "FlightReservationSystem" Class: Manages interaction with the user, displaying options and handling reservations.

3) INSTRUCTION:

· Clone the repository and open the file in your preferred code editor.
· Compile and run the "FlightReservationSystem.java" file.
· Make a reservation by following the on-screen instructions.
